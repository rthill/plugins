# GPIO


## Requirements

RPi.GPIO Python module

Install it with:
```
sudo pip3 install RPi.GPIO --upgrade
```

## Supported Hardware

Raspberry Pi all versions (tested on Raspberry Pi 1 revision 2)

## Configuration

### plugin.yaml

```yaml
GPIO:
   class_name: Raspi_GPIO
   class_path: plugins.gpio
#   mode: BOARD
```

#### `mode`
Define the GPIO PIN Mode that you use to declare the pin numbers. If not set, default is BOARD

Possible modes: BOARD or BCM. More information can be found here:
http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12966/what-is-the-difference-between-board-and-bcm-for-gpio-pin-numbering


### items.yaml

#### gpio_in

Define the pin number of your Raspberry Pi that should be read, i.e. where a sensor is attached. Beware that the number has to follow the rules of the "mode" you have defined in the plugin.yaml (Board or BCM).

#### gpio_out

Define the pin number of your Raspberry Pi that should be written, i.e. where a LED is attached. Beware that the number has to follow the rules of the "mode" you have defined in the plugin.yaml (Board or BCM). The Output-Pin will also automatically be read by the plugin as Input.

#### Example

```yaml
item1:
    type: bool
    visu_acl: ro
    gpio_in: 10
item2:
    type: bool
    visu_acl: rw
    gpio_out: 13
```
